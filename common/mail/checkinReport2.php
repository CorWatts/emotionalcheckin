                    These reports are sent out when Erreth scores above 5 in their checkin.
                    This means that they might be struggling emotionally, and you should
                    contact them to see how they are. Their report results are below. You
                    can reply to this email, and it will go directly to your friend.</p>

                Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it
                right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house,
                fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
                better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm
                sayin'?</p>
                <p><strong>How does it affect the important people in my life?</strong>
                The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities
                of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name
                of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
                for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I
                will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who
                would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
                is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
                <p><strong>Why do I do this? What is the benefit for me?</strong>
                ur bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria
                and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also
                clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
                swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However
                unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve,
                just on opposite ends.</p>
