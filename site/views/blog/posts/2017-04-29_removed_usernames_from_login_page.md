title: "Usernames have been Eliminated"
--------------------------------

As you've likely noticed we've elminated usernames from the Faster Scale App. There wasn't a tangible purpose or use for usernames here; at least none that an email address  couldn't serve. Making our users remember an extraneous username didn't seem very nice. Additionally, we were able to delete a bit of username-related code. Deleting unnecessary code is a great way to keep the project clean and tidy. We've completely deleted all usernames from the database too.

To help you remember **not** put your username in the login page, we've added a reminder just above the form. Additionally, if you enter something that doesn't look like an email address the form will fail to validate.

If you have any questions or encounter any problems please send us a message on the [Contact Form](/contact).
