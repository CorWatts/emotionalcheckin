title: "New Feature: Personal Behaviors"

As a person becomes more familiar with the Faster Scale, sometimes he or she can identify behaviors unique to themselves on their path towards Relapse. These behaviors may not be in the official Faster Scale list, but nonetheless are an important signal to notice.

Many users have asked me over the last several years for the ability to add these kind of "personal behaviors" to the Faster Scale App.

I'm happy to announce this feature is now live.

You can add, update, and remove your own personal behaviors on the <a href="/profile">Profile</a> page. Assign each behavior you create to a FASTER category, and it will appear there on the form during a check-in.

This was a more involved update than I had anticipated, and I've appreciated your patience as I've worked on it. I hope it is helpful to you all!
