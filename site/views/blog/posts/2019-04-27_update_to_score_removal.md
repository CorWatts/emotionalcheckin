title: "UPDATE: Changes to the Upcoming Score Removal Plans"
---------

Many people have contacted me about the upcoming changes described below -- thank you for your feedback! One major theme has been concern over the new (and significantly less useful) "all or nothing" change for partner emails. Inundating partners with email reports that may or may not contain actionable information isn't desirable, but neither is not sending any of them.

In response to your feedback I will be replacing the existing score-based Email Threshold field with a selectable dropdown of FASTER categories ("Forgetting Priorities", "Speeding Up", etc). Each person could choose at which level they'd like an email to be sent. For example: if "Speeding Up" is set as the threshold, whenever behaviors at that level or worse are selected an email will be sent.

I've updated the older original post below and struck through the parts that are no longer applicable.

I hope this is a better solution than the "all or nothing" checkbox. Thank you for your patience!
