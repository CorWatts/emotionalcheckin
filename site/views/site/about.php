    <p>Hopefully you've heard of Michael Dye's emotional checkin tool called the Faster Scale. I've found the Faster Scale helpful in my personal life as I've tried to become more emotionally mindful. People I've talked to find it helpful as well. This aims to be an electronic version of the paper questionaire. It stores a history of your checkins so you can visually see your emotional state change over time. I had a lot of fun building this, and I hope it helps you!</p>

I hope this app helps you to be more mindful of your emotional state. If you have any questions, comments, complaints, or feedback please drop me a line on the contact form!</p>
