          <h3>Useful Analytics & Alerts</h3>
          <p>Everyone loves analytics. View beautiful charts and graphs to gain additional insights to your emotional tendencies. Your daily checkin answers are stored so you can go back to any point in history and view what you were experiencing at that time. You can also choose to send a report to your friends if you score above a certain threshold, which opens up avenues for conversation.</p>

          <h3>Danger Score</h3>
          <p>A Danger Score is calculated for each checkin, allowing you to get a simple summary of how close to relapse you are. As your score goes up, you become more and more likely to relapse. Don't let temptation blindside you into relapse. See it coming before it arrives, and take preventative action.</p>
